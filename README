This is a handful of scripts and libraries that were a part of the Valvalis framework.  This framework was written around 2003, in PHP4.  The version in this repo represents the v3.0 release, aimed at PHP5+, and which was never fully completed.  There is a separate branch for the version 2 release, which was relatively stable and production-ready.
